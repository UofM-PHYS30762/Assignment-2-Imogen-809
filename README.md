Disclosure of Delegation to Generative AI

The authors declare the use of generative AI in the research and writing process. According to the GAIDeT taxonomy (2025), the following tasks were delegated to GAI tools under full human supervision:

- Code generation
- Code optimization

The GAI tool used was: VS code co-pilot, chat GPT-5.
Responsibility for the final manuscript lies entirely with the authors.
GAI tools are not listed as authors and do not bear responsibility for the final outcomes.
Declaration submitted by: Imogen Strong
Additional note: I used Chat GPT-5 to help me work out what was going on when my code wasn't working. For example, I cleaned up the course data memory too early which meant that when I wanted to work out any of the stats, this meant that there was no data to put into that function. I wrote all the skeleton and physical code myself, with the help of VS code co-pilot, which is why I have ticked the 'code generation' box.
